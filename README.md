# Personal Computer Science Roadmap

> My name is Dauletkhan, and currently I finished my 3rd year of undergraduate CS studies. But, I feel I never properly studied CS, only prepared for exams and did homeworks, then I forgot everything I studied.
> This is my attempt to re-study CS to fill the gaps I have in my knowledge.
>
> I did this repo for myself, but if you want you can check it and contribute to it. I think I need to add more README files to easily navigate through repo and decide which book and resource you should use.
